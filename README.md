## About

### 1 Windows

#### 1.1 Main

The main window is consisting of a list view representing your current Font Library. These fonts can be applied to CS:GO.

When a font is selected, the "Apply Selected Font" button will appear, pressing this will prompt you to change the current CS:GO font. If you confirm this, the program will change your font in CS:GO to the new one.

In case you appreciate the program, there is also a button for donations in the shape of trade offers through Steam. 

At the bottom of the window is version information as well as a link to restore the saved path to the CS:GO local files, and a link to see additional information about Font Manager.

##### 1.1.1 Add font

To add a font, press the green "Add Font" button and you will see a new window pop up. Here you can drag and drop zip files containing a collection of fonts or a single font file.

You also have the option to add an already installed font by pressing the "Add System Font" button. This will provide you a font selection dialogue box, where you can select a system font. Press "Ok" when you have selected a font of choice  and it will be added to the Font Library.

At the bottom of the font drag and drop area are two links, one where you can download new fonts, and another to close the window.

##### 1.1.2 Remove font

To delete a font from the Font Manager, you need to select it from the font library and then press the Remove Font button.

This will prompt for confirmation and then remove the stored local files from Font Manager.



> ### NOTICE!
> This will NOT uninstall the font from your system. This must be done manually.

#### 1.2 Add Font

The add font window looks the same as the main window, but here you can select from a list of already installed fonts on your computer. Select one and press the "Add Selected Font" button.
